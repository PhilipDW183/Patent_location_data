# Patent_location_data
A repository for code that merges patents/citations/controls with location data

The exploring geo_coded files uses the first_and_subsequent files from https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/QLT9WM to creat the files used in merging exact location data and EPO.ipynb.

The EPO_treatment_data.csv is used in the merging exact location data and EPO.ipynb file.

The merging excat location data and EPO.ipynb is used to merge the location data, through the first and subsequent file, to the treatment data. The first half can be ignored by explains the way in which EPO_treatment_data.csv is reached at. The second half deals with the merging.
